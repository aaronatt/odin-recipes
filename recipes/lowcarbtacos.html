        <img src="../images/taco-pic.jpeg">

        <p>This is a great low-carb alternative to your standard homemade tacos. 
            I love Mexican food and wasn't willing to part with tacos after starting my low-carb diet. 
            This always satisfies my craving.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 & 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 (4 ounce) can diced jalapeno peppers</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and jalapeno peppers together in a skillet over 
                medium-high heat until meat is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir taco seasoning 
                into meat mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir meat mixture, shredded lettuce, tomato, Cheddar cheese, salsa, and sour cream together 
                in a large bowl. Divide taco mixture among 4 bowls and top each with avocado slices.</li>
        </ol>
